Problem Statement : Write a python program to solve a classic ancient Chinese puzzle. We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have?

   Sample Input             Expected Output

 heads-150 legs-400             100 50
 heads-3 legs-11              No solution
 heads-3 legs-12                  0 3
 heads-5 legs-10                  5 0
  
Solution : 
  
def solve(heads,legs):
    error_msg = "No solution"
    chicken_count = 0
    rabbit_count = 0
    # Start writing your code here
    if legs % 2 == 0 and legs > heads:
        rabbit_count = (legs // 2 ) - heads
        chicken_count = heads - rabbit_count
        print(chicken_count,rabbit_count)
    else:
        print(error_msg)

# Provide different values for heads and legs and test your program
solve(38,131)
