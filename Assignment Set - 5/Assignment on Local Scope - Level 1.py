Problem Statement : The road transport corporation (RTC) of a city wants to know whether a particular bus-route is running on profit or loss.
Assume that the following information are given:
Price per litre of fuel = 70
Mileage of the bus in km/litre of fuel = 10
Price(Rs) per ticket = 80

The bus runs on multiple routes having different distance in kms and number of passengers.
Write a function to calculate and return the profit earned (Rs) in each route. Return -1 in case of loss.

Solution :

def calculate(distance,no_of_passengers):
    #Remove pass and write your logic here
    price = 70
    mileage = 10
    ticket = 80
    ticket_earning = no_of_passengers * ticket
    profit = ticket_earning-((distance/mileage)*price)
    if profit > 0:
        return profit
    else:
        return -1

# Provide different values for distance, no_of_passenger and test your program
distance=20
no_of_passengers=50
print(calculate(distance,no_of_passengers))
